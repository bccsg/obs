# CycleSets for OBS

**CycleSets** is an OBS Studio Lua script that lets you define **profiles of scenes** and cycle through them with **multi-tap hotkeys**.  

Unlike the default *Next/Previous Scene* hotkeys (which cycle through all scenes in your collection), CycleSets gives you fine control over **which scenes are included**, their **order**, and provides **per-profile hotkeys**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Profiles**  
  - Create, rename, and delete multiple scene profiles.  
  - Each profile contains an ordered list of scenes.  
  - Independent hotkeys per profile.  

- **UI-driven scene selection**  
  - Pick scenes directly from OBS‚Äôs scene list (no typing names).  
  - Add, remove, and reorder with buttons.  

- **Multi-tap hotkeys**  
  - First press ‚Üí recalls the last selected scene.  
  - Further presses within a short window ‚Üí advance/step back.  
  - Pause longer than the window resets to last selected.  

- **Per-profile hotkeys**  
  - `Cycle Scenes (Profile: <Name>): Next`  
  - `Cycle Scenes (Profile: <Name>): Previous`  
  - Hotkeys are created when profiles exist, and automatically removed if profiles are deleted.  
  - Renaming a profile migrates its hotkey bindings automatically.  

- **Auto-pruning**  
  - If you delete a scene in OBS, it is automatically removed from all profiles.  

- **Persistence**  
  - Profiles, last selected scene index, and hotkey bindings persist across OBS restarts.
